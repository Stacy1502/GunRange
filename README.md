Project for IMD 3901, Assignment 2

Virtual reality gun range made with A-Frame, optimized for PC and mobile use. The environment is a dim room, with the effect of stars 
lighting it up. In addition, majority of objects have an emissive property and thus have a glowing effect. 

Once the user clicks the play button, that are taken to the room with three guns placed in front of them and instructions to select 
one. When a gun is selected, the user “picks up” that colour gun and targets spawn in front of them. The user may shoot these targets 
(spacebar on PC and clicking the gun on mobile) and when a target is hit, it disappears. 

Along with the targets, two buttons appear, one to reset the targets and the other to put down the gun. If the user presses the reset 
target button, all targets are respawned. If the user presses the put down gun button, they are no longer holding a gun and the three 
original guns are respawned on the table for the user to choose one again.
